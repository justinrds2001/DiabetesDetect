      We provided you with a comprehensive explanation of the prediction (Figure
      1). It uses a Shap plot to illustrate the factors that influenced the
      outcome.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Positive contributions (in blue) represent factors that decrease the
        likelihood of diabetes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Negative contributions (in red) indicate factors that increase the
        likelihood of diabetes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The length of each bar indicates the magnitude of that particular
        contribution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By analyzing the magnitude and direction of these contributions, you can
      gain insights into how the model arrived at its decision.

    <h4>Advice</h4>
    <p *ngIf="prediction.diabetes">
      Based on the prediction, we recommend that you consult a doctor as soon as
      possible to confirm the diagnosis. Early detection and treatment can be
      beneficial in preventing complications.
    </p>
    <p *ngIf="!prediction.diabetes">
      Based on the prediction, you are unlikely to have diabetes. However, we
      recommend that you consult a doctor if you experience any symptoms.
